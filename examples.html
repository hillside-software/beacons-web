		                    <p>
		                        Beacons will be launched in a pilot program at 50 Target stores. They are being very careful to avoid spamming their customers. Shoppers must first install the Target iOS App (Android is coming soon) and then opt-in to receive the notifications. Only a max of 2 push notifications for deals per visit will be sent. The other deals will be available in the app but will not be pushed. They will be using the data to help understand trends and customer preferences.

They had previously let their app users see how certain products might look in their homes. More recently, they are connecting consumerâ€™s online shopping carts and wish lists with their in-store experience.

		                        Macy's launched iBeacons back in 2013 and now have over 4,000 in action. According to a company spokesman “In a funny way, we’re going back 100 years when people were known by name….when they walked in, people knew who they were, and they were greeted. They knew what they might be looking for based on their previous purchases.” Now departments in a store can arrange these experiences using iBeacons (e.g. the jewelry department can offer a discount on earrings).

		                    <p>
		                        This is a great example of how an art museum is using beacon technology. The visitor downloads the app from the App Store. When they walk through the museum, a beacon identifies when they are near a particular piece of art. The museum's app provides information about each display, using your distance from beacons placed alongside the exhibit. As long as visitors to the museum have the app installed and Bluetooth turned on, they are automatically sent information on each artwork as they pass by. Beacons can be used to point the user to similar exhibits nearby, making it a personalized tour of the museum.

		                        The new and improved Badger Gameday App was launched just in time for the volleyball teamâ€™s season opener. Updates include a better news display, in-venue replay and of course beacon integration. With the beacons (plus geofencing), fans will receive highly relevant content and location based notifications. Fans that opt in to the beacon functionality will be delivered content based on their location, activities, the time and their interests inside both Camp Randall and the Kohl Center. Many professional sports teams are already taking advantage of beacons â€“ now they are making their way to the university sports realm, where there are many more teams.

		                    <p>
		                        In a bid to make the ballpark experience more engaging for fans, Major League Baseball plans to roll out Apple's new iBeacons technology to deliver targeted information and offers based on a fan's location within the park, according to a new report. Citi Field, home of the Mets, is already experimenting with embedded videos, dynamic hot dog coupons, and straight-to-your-seat navigationâ€”the augmented ballpark of the future, all built on iBeacon.

It will be providing customizable information andÂ can be used on iOS (including theApple Watch). Features includeÂ time race results, racer profiles and a detailed spectator guide. On site interviews and videos from vehicles will be posted as well. iBeacons will be used during the Fan Fest. Every vehicle with beacon technology that is near the user will be identified in real-time, even if they do not have access to the Internet.

		                    <p>
		                        Virgin Atlantic Airways was one of the earliest adopters of beacons in travel by installing beacons at Londonâ€™s Heathrow airport. An electronic boarding pass loaded on iPhoneâ€™s Passbook app is able to receive messages from the beacons based on the userâ€™s location in Heathrow. The app then gives directions to the gate, and even warns you if you are going to be late or if the flight is delayed.

		                        Car dealers have plans to place beacons on showroom models. As a potential customer checks out the car, the beacon will send information straight to their smartphone. For example, one in the front could talk about its engine. One in the back could talk about its advanced parking technology.Â The beacons also could be used out in the lot, with off-hours shoppers getting pitched on highlights of the various models.

		                    <h3>Tribeca Film Festival Uses iBeacons</h3>
		                    <p>
		                        The Tribeca Film Festival app uses iBeacons to alert users about nearby venues, screening times and offers. Users nearby the theaters can purchase tickets directly from inside the app, or find out what films or events their friends preferred to attend. Once a screening is over and the user exits the venue, it allows an easy way for viewers to share opinions by using the app.

		                    <p>
		                        Starbucks is innovating with muchÂ more than free Wi-Fi in the tech space. They are on the cutting edge when it comes to big brands and IoT. They are rumored to have plans to make it possible for you to order a drink and then a beacon would notify the barista when you enter the store. A step in this direction is anÂ experiment in New York with employees taking orders with a handheld device from customers as they enter the store.
